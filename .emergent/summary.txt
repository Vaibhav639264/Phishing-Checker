The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and built an email phishing detection application from scratch. The initial phase delivered a functional MVP for manual email uploads with AI-powered analysis using Gemini 2.0-flash. The project then transitioned to real-time email integration, focusing on Gmail via IMAP after encountering Google OAuth verification hurdles. Key developments included a multi-layered detection engine (URL, attachment, social engineering, AI), an alerting system, a monitoring dashboard, and enterprise features for multi-account management. The engineer faced recurring bugs related to IMAP connection persistence, manual scan functionality, real-time monitoring, and alert delivery, diligently debugging and refactoring code, including adding timeouts and improving error handling. The final interaction highlights persistent critical issues, prompting a significant re-architecture of core backend components to deliver a perfect and fully functional system.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a tool for identifying malicious or phishing emails. Initially, the core requirement was a manual email upload interface that scans and identifies phishing or malicious content. This was built using a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database, integrating with the Gemini 2.0-flash LLM for analysis. The system was designed to perform URL decoding, redirection detection, visual mismatch detection, and provide threat assessments with detailed explanations.

Subsequent requirements transformed the tool into an enterprise-grade solution:
1.  **Real-time Email Provider Integration**: The user explicitly requested automatic scanning integrated with their email provider (specifically Gmail, and potentially Outlook).
2.  **Automated Actions**: The system should Send Alert Notification and Block the sender and mark as spam for detected threats.
3.  **Persistence and Reliability**: Ensure IMAP connection persistence, reliable manual scanning, and consistent real-time monitoring.
4.  **Advanced Detection**: Implement comprehensive analysis, including scanning attachments and analyzing full email trails/threads.
5.  **Monitoring and Management**: Develop a monitoring dashboard and features for managing multiple Gmail accounts (for 250 employees in an organization) with centralized blocking logs and alerts.
6.  **Accuracy and Robustness**: The tool must accurately detect known phishing attempts (e.g., Office-365 credential harvesting) and deliver alerts reliably without disconnections or undetected threats.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: FastAPI (Python) backend, React.js frontend, MongoDB database.
-   **AI/LLM Integration**:  library used with Google's Gemini 2.0-flash model for email content analysis.
-   **Email Integration**: Gmail API (initially OAuth-based, then switched to IMAP/SMTP with App Passwords due to verification issues).
-   **Environment Variables**: Strict usage of  (frontend) and  (backend).
-   **Containerization**: Application runs in a Kubernetes container environment.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For frontend styling.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:


-   : This is the central FastAPI application. It defines all API endpoints (), integrates various services (IMAP, LLM, scanner), and orchestrates the email analysis and management workflow. It was initially set up for manual email uploads, then extended for Gmail integration (both OAuth and IMAP), real-time monitoring, debugging, and multi-account management. Recent edits fixed circular import issues and integrated advanced scanning/thread analysis, and also received a significant rewrite as  and  are part of the last batch of changes.
-   : Handles the IMAP connection logic for fetching and managing emails. It was created as an alternative to Google OAuth and has undergone multiple refinements to improve credential handling, error reporting, and connection stability by adding timeouts.
-   : Contains the core logic for parsing email content, extracting URLs, analyzing headers, and preparing data for the LLM and advanced scanner. This file is being rewritten or significantly updated in the current work.
-   : Implements advanced security checks for URLs and attachments (e.g., domain reputation, file signatures). It was created to enhance detection capabilities but initially faced  dependency issues, leading to a simplified, non-external-library-dependent version.
-   : A new module for analyzing multi-turn email conversations or trails to detect sophisticated phishing attacks that span multiple messages.
-   : A new module designed to manage the configuration and monitoring of multiple employee email accounts for enterprise use cases.
-   : Manages the background task that periodically checks email inboxes for new messages and triggers the analysis pipeline. It was updated to work robustly with IMAP.
-   : Stores environment variables like  and placeholders for API keys (e.g., , , , , , ). It was edited multiple times to add/update credentials and ensure persistence.
-   : The main React component rendering the UI. It incorporates the email upload, analysis display, Gmail/IMAP setup forms, monitoring dashboard, and enterprise management panels. It handles user interactions and makes API calls to the backend. It has seen extensive modifications for new features, error messages, and validation logic.
-   : Stylesheet for the  component, using Tailwind CSS patterns.
-    (hypothetical, as  has dashboard logic): Contains the UI elements and logic for displaying real-time monitoring statistics and system health.
-    (hypothetical, as  has enterprise logic): Contains the UI elements and logic for adding and managing multiple employee accounts.
-   : Essential for tracking testing progress and protocols, constantly read and updated.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Full Resolution of Current Bugs**: The most pressing task is to address all issues reported in the last message, specifically: connection disconnection on refresh, non-functional manual scan, real-time monitoring failure, alert function not working, and detection failure for specific phishing emails (including mail trails).
-   **Reliable Multi-Account Monitoring**: Ensure the enterprise multi-account feature works perfectly for 250 employees.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in a critical phase, having received a comprehensive bug report from the user detailing multiple persistent failures: connection dropping on refresh, manual scan not working (finishing too quickly for large inboxes), real-time monitoring failing, alert function not triggering, and the system failing to detect a provided phishing email (an Office-365 credential harvesting attempt, and a mail trail).

In response to this high-priority, last attempt request, the AI engineer has decided to completely rebuild the core components to work flawlessly. This immediate action involves a significant rewrite of several backend files:
-   : Likely being reconfigured to ensure robust credential persistence.
-   : A new or heavily refactored IMAP service, suggesting a more resilient approach to managing email connections and fetching.
-   : The main FastAPI application, undergoing a major overhaul to integrate the robust IMAP service and ensure all core functionalities (detection, alerts, monitoring) work seamlessly and reliably.
-   : The core email parsing and analysis logic, being rewritten to ensure accurate and comprehensive detection for all email types, including complex mail trails.

The engineer has just finished writing these four critical files and restarting the backend services. The immediate next step is to test the system with the exact phishing email the user provided to verify that the core detection capabilities are now functioning as expected.
